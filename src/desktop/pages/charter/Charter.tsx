            We, Scotland's Instagrammers, love our beautiful country. However, we are concerned
            about the natural environment and want to ensure that it is conserved in a beautiful
            condition for future generations to enjoy. We recognise the rare privilege of statutory
            access rights to most of the Scottish outdoors, and wish to guarantee that such a
            privilege is not being wrongfully exploited. We acknowledge that we can only hold access
            rights if we exercise them responsibly (Section 1., Scottish Outdoor Access Code 2015).
