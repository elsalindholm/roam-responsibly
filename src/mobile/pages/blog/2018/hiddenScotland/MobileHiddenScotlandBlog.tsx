              This month we launched the Hidden Scotland Tour which is a small group adventure where
              you can experience some of the most dramatic landscapes Scotland has to offer. This
              3-day tour guides you on an unforgettable journey from Glasgow, through magnificent
              glens and inspiring mountainscapes all the way to the Isle of Skye. The tour is taken
              by photographer Andrew Alexander. Andrew has an in depth understanding of the
              Highlands and Skye, which he has developed over the last 5 years and he is looking
              forward to sharing his knowledge and vision with you."

            Hidden Scotland is a brilliant example of how a tourism business can incorporate raising
            awareness of responsible outdoor access in what they do. Not only will Hidden Scotland
            be promoting and sharing the message through their website and social media channels,
            but raising awareness will also be a part of their new Hidden Scotland Tour.
