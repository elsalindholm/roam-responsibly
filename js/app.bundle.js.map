I was very anxious about working away from my partner and home in Tobermory.\r\n            Because of the ferry route, I sailed past our house on that first trip - with my\r\n            belongings packed into the car below. When you’re full of doubt and you have tears in\r\n            your eyes, it takes something very special to change your mind. Tiree is special.

Each April, our machair is a fried-egg medley of white daisies and yellow\r\n            buttercups. Sometimes the daisy carpet grows so thick, it could be mistaken for snowfall\r\n            (which we rarely get, thanks to our maritime climate).\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , saf-first-machair'}></div>\r\n          <p className={'mblog-img-caption'}>\r\n            The first machair flowers in April.

Photo by Stephanie Cope.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            One of my first jobs was to install new signage and interpretation. Digging down into\r\n            the ‘soil’ at our beach parking areas, I was horrified to discover nothing more than\r\n            sand - with a smudge of greyish organic colour, barely a hand deep. If the binding\r\n            surface vegetation wears away, this sand is exposed to our howling winds and quickly\r\n            erodes. Thus, vehicles can be an incredibly damaging influence, and off-road access must\r\n            be managed to ensure sustainability. Machair plains provide essential winter grazing for\r\n            the crofting sector, so any damage represents a loss to small-scale agriculture and a\r\n            loss to our threatened wildlife.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            On Tiree, we ask our guests to use marked parking areas to access beaches; rather than\r\n            driving freely over unfenced land. We also ask that our guests use approved overnight\r\n            camping pitches instead of camping informally from their vehicles (see more{' '}\r\n            <a\r\n              className={'mblog-link'}\r\n              href={'http://www.isleoftiree.com/out-about/camping-and-campervans/'}\r\n              target={'_blank'}\r\n            >\r\n              here\r\n            </a>\r\n            ). Both actions have mitigated damage and improved outcomes for crofting and\r\n            conservation. Historically, this management of vehicle access proved controversial -\r\n            though a good level of understanding and acceptance has now taken root, thanks to\r\n            engagement and education. The main issue, in my view, is a lack of clarity in the\r\n            Scottish Outdoor Access Code.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            For the casual traveller (and, it has to be said, particularly for my fellow Englishmen\r\n            and women) the distinction between true Wild Camping and camping informally from a\r\n            vehicle is not sufficiently clear. A significant proportion of guests genuinely and\r\n            innocently believe that Wild Camping includes the use of a vehicle; that Wild Camping\r\n            rights therefore extend to vehicle users; and that they have a right under Scottish law\r\n            to access open land, with a vehicle, for the purpose of camping. This includes the use\r\n            of roadside locations such as old stone quarries or unmarked pull-in points. These\r\n            guests are naturally surprised when asked to adhere to the requests above - either\r\n            through Tiree’s visitor guidance or in person. I am regularly assured that such access\r\n            is ‘allowed everywhere else’. It isn’t, and this is an awkward conversation to have for\r\n            all parties. Guests may be left feeling a little unsure or even put out; and I must\r\n            intrude on their holiday to request a change in behaviour. Not something I enjoy.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Because Tiree has taken measures to promote compliance with the Scottish Outdoor Access\r\n            Code, there is a perception that a ‘right’ to camp informally with vehicles is being\r\n            withheld. In fact, the above restrictions apply across Scotland; it’s just that in many\r\n            communities, informal camping is tolerated because it hasn’t reached damaging levels.\r\n            Informal camping is not sustainable on Tiree and we have had to take steps to manage it;\r\n            in part because of this lack of clarity. Therefore, I argue that this distinction needs\r\n            to be made more explicit in Scottish Outdoor Access Code guidance. We welcome more than\r\n            twenty thousand guests per year (and remember, the island is less than 80km2). Our\r\n            machair simply cannot withstand that kind of unchecked vehicle pressure. Or at least,\r\n            not without squashing quite a few lapwing chicks.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , saf-redshank'}></div>\r\n          <p className={'mblog-img-caption'}>\r\n            This Redshank chick is just one of the many groundnesting birds that breed on Tiree.\r\n            Photo by Stephanie Cope.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , saf-highland-cow'}></div>\r\n          <p className={'mblog-img-caption'}>\r\n            Small-scale, traditional crofting underpins Tiree's incredible biodiversity.

It is important to try,\r\n            whenever possible, to pick up a few pieces of rubbish on your way up a munro or on a\r\n            stroll along a lovely Scottish beach. However, we can also start dealing with this\r\n            litter problem by reducing the amount of waste we produce in our day-to-day lives,\r\n            because unfortunately a lot of it, especially plastics, end up in nature whether\r\n            disposed correctly or not.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            In July 2018, the Marine Coservation Society will be running their Plastic Challenge and\r\n            encouraging people to <strong>#GoPlasticFree</strong> for a month - and of course to\r\n            continue this forever after. Plastic is everywhere around us and, although a wonderfully\r\n            versatile material, it is grossly overused and not much of it can currently be recycled,\r\n            making it a real problem in terms of disposal. We have all seen sad news about how badly\r\n            plastic is affecting the nature and wildlife all around the world. MCS's Plastic\r\n            Challenge is a great opportunity for you to push yourself out of your comfort zone,\r\n            think about how your could reduce your impact and to start making a real difference by\r\n            reducing single-use plastics. Taking part in the campaign and reducing use of plastics\r\n            will help with global problem with waste and plastic pollution, protecting our seas and\r\n            wildlife and hopefully influence decision makers to steer society towards stronger\r\n            sustinability.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Ready to take the challenge?

Our destination\r\n            for the afternoon was a beach clean event organised by An Cridhe and Coll Bunkhouse\r\n            management team with considerable input and support from RSPB team, which was going to\r\n            take place in the vast Crossapol beach in the south west tip of Coll. We were probably a\r\n            bit less than an hour's walk from the beach when a car stopped behind us and two ladies\r\n            offered us a lift to the event. This is when we met Jane, one of the organisers of the\r\n            event and one of the lovely people who run An Cridhe and Coll Bunkhouse.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            With this blog post, I am pleased to introduce you to our newest partners:{' '}\r\n            <a className={'mblog-link'} href={'https://ancridhe.com/'} target={'_blank'}>\r\n              An Cridhe\r\n            </a>{' '}\r\n            and{' '}\r\n            <a className={'mblog-link'} href={'https://collbunkhouse.com/'} target={'_blank'}>\r\n              Coll Bunkhouse\r\n            </a>\r\n            .

Both are managed by lovely and hospitable staff and housed in beautiful new\r\n            buildings, which have been built to a high environmentally friendly standard.

However, this particular weekend, the high winds had brought more plastic to\r\n            the beach. There must have been at least 20 people who turned up for the beach clean and\r\n            we walked along the beach removing all kinds of plastic waste from the sand from milk\r\n            and drinks bottles and bottle tops to cotton bud and lollopop sticks and even a safety\r\n            helmet. A staggering amount of plastic was collected from this one beach and it made me\r\n            wonder, how much plastic each tide brings in and how much must be buried under the sand\r\n            already.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , coll-beach-clean-one'}></div>\r\n          <p className={'mblog-img-caption'}>\r\n            Crossapol beach clean.

Many small island communities struggle with waste management - their waste\r\n            has to be transported away from the island and this limits the amount of waste they can\r\n            generate, store and transport. On top of this all, they have to deal with plastic waste\r\n            being washed on the shores of the islands. I asked Jane if they did beach cleans often\r\n            on Coll and she said that they try to but she also reminded me that with full-time jobs,\r\n            it is not always easy to find the time for it. Locals, with help from the local RSPB\r\n            team are making it easier for the visitors to the island to pick up and bin any waste\r\n            they find on the beach by utilising existing bins and having new signage. For example,\r\n            there is a bin that visitors can use at the Crossapol carpark.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , coll-beach-clean-two'}></div>\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , coll-beach-clean-three'}></div>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Earlier in the the day, in the spirit of the beach clean I had picked up plastic bottles\r\n            or other pieces of rubbish on other beaches on the way to Crossapol. Some of the pieces\r\n            were too big for me to move and I felt bad for having to leave them behind, but I\r\n            cleaned up what I could. The RSPB has an information centre on the island about the\r\n            wonderful birds that you can find on Coll. They were encouraging people to do 2-minute\r\n            beach cleans, which practically means picking up a few pieces whenever out and about. I\r\n            have recently been increasingly aware of my impact on the local environment and\r\n            community when I visit places. Perhaps this is one way we tourists and visitors can give\r\n            back and help the local community, environment and wildlife.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <div className={'mblog-img , coll-sunset'}></div>\r\n          <p className={'mblog-img-caption'}>\r\n            Sunset in Arinagour.

When the sky\r\n            finally cleared after the rainy day, we were treated to a magnificent sunset. On our\r\n            last day the lovely Alison, who works for An Cridhe and Coll Bunkhouse, was kind enough\r\n            to take us to the other side of the island to spot some Corncrakes before she was headed\r\n            to work. Despite these birds being very shy we actually managed to see one! After a long\r\n            day of walking and a lunch in the Coll Hotel, we went to pick up our bags and started to\r\n            walk towards the ferry. On single-lane roads, you are used to jumping off the road to\r\n            give way to cars as soon as you hear them. I heard a car behind me and jumped off the\r\n            road, but the car stopped. It was Jane, who had seen us leave and she offered to take us\r\n            back to the ferry. Coll is a beautiful place to visit and has a lot of exciting\r\n            wildlife, but what blew me away the most was people's hospitality and openness. Even in\r\n            every car that passed us by the driver greeted us with a wave a big smile on their\r\n            faces. I felt very welcome!\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <h3>BELOW ARE SOME USEFUL LINKS:</h3>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a className={'mblog-link'}
